                      <p>
                        In search of the best WordPress guide plugin or tool, we
                        built WP Guidant, the ULTIMATE Guided Selling Process
                        for WordPress. <br /><br />
                        A guided Selling system is a software-based solution for
                        online marketplaces that deal with a ton of customer and
                        product data. Having a simple guided selling process can
                        boost your sales traffic tremendously by sorting the
                        mountain of data smartly while improving the supply line
                        to another level.
                        <br /><br />
                        Sometimes, having enough hands around your shop doesn’t
                        help to sell fast. For online shops, the situation
                        becomes more tense as the number of visitors increases.
                        However, a reliable WordPress Guide Plugin like WP
                        Guidant can satisfy the growing number of customers by
                        serving them quickly on your WordPress site.
                        <br /><br />
                        But that’s all in words unless you try. So the question
                        is, what makes WP Guidant so unique for your online
                        marketplace?

                        <br /><br />
                        Let’s find out!

                    <div class="para-01">
                      <h2>Why do you need a guided selling system?</h2>
                      <p>
                        With the change of time, the system around our online
                        marketplace has changed a lot. Before, there were all
                        kinds of retail shops here and there, selling products
                        and doing business. <br /><br />
                        As we stepped into the world of the World Wide Web, most
                        of the retail shops converted into
                        <br /><br />
                        online marketplaces. Now digital shops can be seen
                        everywhere, while most of them are based on WordPress
                        software. The WordPress site is fast, easy to access,
                        and doesn’t need you to step out of your residence.
                        <br /><br />
                        As people love to get comfortable while shopping, the
                        majority get along with online shops to avoid crowds.
                        These virtual shops can hold 100 times more products
                        than a regular shop could hold.
                        <br /><br />
                        With the massive shift in the store’s capacity comes a
                        whole new kind of burden. The WordPress shopping
                        community has been facing these burdens for a long time
                        now-
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- Single Blog -->
                    <div class="para-01">
                      <h2>Lack Of Control Over The Products</h2>
                      <p>
                        Before, the retail shop owners could play the cards to
                        pull visitors to become their customers. But now, the
                        customer has the drivers’ seat. Any visitor can freely
                        access online shops to look for their desired product.
                        In fact, the majority leave empty-handed just because
                        they didn’t find the right product or your shop failed
                        to display related products.
                        <br /><br />
                        In retail shops, the sales reps usually spend a great
                        deal of time learning about the products to help
                        customers make the decision quickly. However, in online
                        shops like a regular shopping WordPress website, the
                        lack of control for displaying the right product
                        off-the-shelf or showing WooCommerce recommended
                        products prove harmful for the sales.

                      <h2>Having Less Time For Selling A Product</h2>
                      <p>
                        Usually, any customer visiting an online shop prefers to
                        do their shopping in less time possible. The reason
                        people choose online shops is that the majority are job
                        holders who tend to be busy to the last minute. So, you
                        get only a tiny amount of time to catch their attention
                        to buy your product.
                        <br /><br />
                        For ease of access, a WordPress website gives you the
                        ability to display a ton of product categories in your
                        shop, making it easy for people to choose fast. But that
                        isn’t enough anymore. Aside from a faster site, people
                        need a quicker way of finding their desired product.
                        Lacking a proper product advisor tool or WooCommerce
                        product guide for displaying WooCommerce related
                        products can lower the sales volume pretty down.
                        <br /><br />
                        That’s why you are losing more customers every day due
                        to the lack of a proper WordPress Guide Plugin to help
                        them shop faster. Sadly, WordPress didn’t have a
                        dedicated WooCommerce buying guide to ease this problem.
                        But now, it has!

                      <h2>Massive Volume of Products That Needs Sorting</h2>
                      <p>
                        Most WooCommerce websites have a ton of products lying
                        around for sale. Therefore, the shop owner needs a
                        decent amount of effort to short all these products
                        according to their respective category. In case the
                        volume is too high, you can only see disappointments
                        from the customers.
                        <br /><br />
                        Because no one wants to go through hundreds of product
                        pages to find just one product, people will quickly get
                        bored from all the browsing and switch to another
                        competitor’s website. This is a problem that only a
                        decent WooCommerce product buying guide tool could
                        solve.
                        <br /><br />
                        Now that you know the problems affecting your sales,
                        it’s time to step up to find the right solution for this
                        problem. Then again, what should you do in order to
                        boost your sales without affecting the clients’
                        intention? That’s where WP Guidant enters the show.
                        <br /><br />

                        faster by picking the right products out of the list.
                        It’s an interactive interface that leaves the users with
                        a couple of product quiz. By answering them, the users
                        get to find the detail of the product they wanted in the

                        This is comparable to an expert sales representative,

                        For the World of WooCommerce, WP Guidant is a brand new
                        name. It’s the most powerful WordPress guide plugin for
                        online shops and marketplaces.
                        <br /><br />
                        As we have already mentioned, a guided selling system
                        involves a software-based interface that converses with
                        the customers and recommends products/services they
                        desire the most.
                        <br /><br />
                        WP Guidant kind of works with the same theory. It lets
                        you create a WooCommerce product guide based on the
                        existing data on your WordPress website. The whole guide
                        is made with a series of filters. Each filter is set to
                        process any specific attribute of the current data.
                        Combined together, the guide can display recommended
                        products as the result.
                        <br /><br />
                        Before, customers needed to search for their desired
                        products within the long list of goods. With this
                        WordPress guided selling plugin, customers only need to
                        answer the product quiz to find the right product. All
                        of it happens in a couple of seconds. This is comparable
                        to an expert sales representative, but a virtual one.
                        Instead of actual people, the WP Guidant plugin AI does
                        the job of showing WooCommerce recommended products to
                        help customers decide.
                        <br /><br />
                        So, how does a single plugin changes everything? Here
                        are five secrets about the best WordPress guide plugin.

                      />
                      <p>
                        The most outstanding feature that makes WP Guidant the
                        ultimate guided selling process is the intelligent
                        filters for displaying related products. The plugin can
                        read the existing data on your WordPress website and
                        create filters out of them.
                        <br /><br />
                        When we developed WP Guidant, we didn’t want it to
                        perform only a particular role but be a box full of
                        surprises. That’s why the plugin Filters can read-write
                        data from WooCommerce and others like posts, titles,
                        tags, meta, pages, ACF, etc. There’s no visible limit to
                        the data number and amount.
                        <br /><br />
                        Also, these intelligent filters can produce
                        instantaneous results no matter how vast the data is. WP
                        Guidant will display the product with the most priority
                        based on the filters and related products on the same
                        page. That leaves the user with everything at hand that
                        they might be searching for.

                      <p>
                        Certainly, people want pictures more than just words in
                        an online shop. You want to present them with the
                        WooCommerce related products they were looking for. But,
                        how do you do that?
                        <br /><br />
                        That’s possible with the user-integrated card filters of
                        WP Guidant. The Card filters can display the product
                        image with a title and description to help the users
                        choose what they want to see.
                        <br /><br />
                        For example-
                        <br /><br />
                        The picture above shows a WooCommerce product guide for
                        t-shirts. Here, the guide has 3 card filters for three
                        different product categories. Selecting any filter takes
                        the users to the next step based on the selected product
                        card. This is a chain process that connects the
                        remaining filters to process the product data according
                        to the selection.
                        <br /><br />
                        If a user chooses the v-neck tee, then presses “Next”
                        and selects the price range, the result will show the
                        optimum v-neck tees within the budget range. This is a
                        2-step guide for t-shirts.

                      <p>
                        Conditional logic is one of the top-secret techniques to
                        boost your sales using a guided selling process. For a
                        multi-step guide, it becomes necessary to put separate
                        filters for specific filter elements. To put it simply-
                        <br /><br />
                        Suppose you have product A and product B on filter 1.
                        You want to sell product A but want to rent product B.
                        That requires you to put separate info on the 2nd filter
                        for the two different choices.
                        <br /><br />
                        WP Guidant’s innovative Conditional Logic system makes
                        it possible to create different filters, set logic on
                        the filter elements, and show results based on that
                        system. That’s how the users will get to see the
                        specific filter by selecting their desired product
                        guide.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Lastly, WP Guidant can modify the results based on their
                        attributes. Confused? Well, it’s common for admins to be
                        unable to customize the product search result on your
                        WooCommerce website. But it’s only possible using WP
                        Guidant.
                        <br /><br />
                        Not only can you select the result attributes like
                        price, tag, category, but also you can arrange them
                        differently for other guides. Like the filter
                        attributes, there’s a lot of choices for selecting the
                        result attributes. This way, you could display more/less
                        information about the WooCommerce related products on
                        the result page as you want.

                        WP Guidant has a built-in database that collects reports
                        from completed guided selling processes from the users.
                        The report contains every detail the user has gone
                        through, including forms, card filters, slider filters,
